what is structure?
structure means collection of variables. 
each variable in structure can be of different datatype.
all the variables in collection must be somehow logically related to each other.
each variable in structure is called member variable.
structure is used to create our own datatypes. so it is called user defined datatype.
structure is used because in c language we can not create single variable which can store different type of value.
structure can represent real word problems. for example we can create structure student iwhich we can store all the information of student as single unit.
we can also pass structure variable into function to reduce arguments in function. and we can also return structure type variable from function to return multiple value from function. 

how to create structure
syntax 
struct structure-name 
{
    datatype variable;
    datatype variable;
    datatype variable;
};

example 
struct time 
{
    int hour;
    int minute;
};

we can create array inside structure. which is called array within structure.
we can create array of structure. which is called array of structure.
